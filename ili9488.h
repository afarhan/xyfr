// ili9488.h — a minimal ILI9488 driver for the text engine. No TFT_eSPI, no
// Adafruit_GFX, no LVGL: just SPI bring-up, an address window, and a fast bulk
// pixel push.
//
// THE ONE FACT THAT SHAPES EVERYTHING: the ILI9488 over SPI is an 18-bit panel.
// It takes 3 bytes per pixel (RGB666) over SPI, NOT RGB565. So a full
// 480x320 frame is 460,800 bytes; at 66 MHz that is ~56 ms and full-frame
// repaints are off the table. One 480x24 text line is ~34.5 KB, ~4.2 ms.
// That asymmetry is why the text engine composes a line and blits it once.
//
// The register sequences and the SPI fast paths here were lifted from TFT_eSPI
// after identifying which of its many #ifdef branches actually compile for this
// board (probing with #error, since the library's nesting makes reading it
// unreliable). The live ones were: the generic setWindow's RP2040 arm,
// SPI_18BIT pushPixels, and TFT_Drivers/ILI9488_Init.h.

// Push a packed 4bpp COVERAGE band (the text engine's compose format) as a
// blend between bg and fg. `cov` is row-major, `stride` bytes per row, two
// pixels per byte (high nibble = even x). This is the hot path: the 16 possible
// coverage values are pre-blended into a lookup table, so per pixel it is one
// nibble extract and three table-driven byte writes — no arithmetic.

// rgb() lives in text_engine.h: it builds a colour, it does not touch the panel,
// and the layers above must be able to name a colour without including this.
